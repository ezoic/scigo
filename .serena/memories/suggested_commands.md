## CI/CD Related
The CI workflow checks:
1. gofumpt formatting
2. goimports formatting with local flag
3. golangci-lint
4. go mod tidy
5. Tests with coverage

Always run these checks before pushing:
```bash
# Quick check
goimports -l -local github.com/ezoic/scigo .
gofumpt -l .
go mod tidy
go test -short ./...
```
